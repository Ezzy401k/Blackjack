Day 11 of 100-day Python coding challenge

# Blackjack Game

This Python program is an implementation of the popular card game Blackjack, where the player competes against the computer to reach a score of 21 without going over.

## How it Works
The game starts with the player and the computer each receiving two cards. The player can then choose to draw additional cards ('hit') or end their turn ('stand'). The player wins if their score is closer to 21 than the computer's score without exceeding it. The game includes logic for Blackjack (an initial score of 21 with two cards), busting (exceeding 21), and determining the winner based on the final scores.

## Features
- Interactive text-based gameplay.
- Random card dealing and shuffling.
- Automatic determination of winner based on final scores.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezzy401k/blackjack.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd blackjack
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python blackjack.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to play the game.

## Example

```python
python blackjack.py
```

```
Welcome to Blackjack!
